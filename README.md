Penguin
=======
In this assignment you will write a program that displays a penguin or any other animal of your choice. You can use any drawing functions that you would like. Check the pictures below for examples of other students work for this assignment. Your program does not have to look just like the picture of mine above, the precise picture you draw is entirely up to you -- be creative and have fun!
